"""The checker: reads a folded graph, emits findings, decides.

Deterministic, no model in the loop, no solver, no network.  Given a graph it
returns the same findings every time, and `gp check` exits 0 iff there are
none above the configured severity floor.

The checker never grades evidence and the ladder never licenses a transport.
Those are orthogonal axes and conflating them is how a project ends up with an
`independently-audited` predicate imported across an edge that forbids it.
